1. Install latest version TF (0.10rc0) on nodes
2. Copy dataset on OpenPower cluster
3. Copy and *untar dataset on nodes
4. Commit code to gitlab: Altoros
5. Pull code on OpenPower cluster and nodes
6. Configure run-scripts and run: 1 PS-Node and N Worker-Node
	6.1 Update CuDNN library on nodes :(
	6.2 "git pull" to update code
	6.3 change Starter SHELL-script: 1 PS-Node + 8 Worker-Nodes
	6.4 synchronize code between nodes
	6.5 Run ...
	6.6 Try collect logs from nodes
	6.7 We use Asynchronous training: average speed on one node is ~10 (images/sec)
	6.8 wait ...
	6.9 Sync after ~1 hour: speed is the same, almost 80% done
	6.10 wait...
	6.11 Chek Python-precesse on Nodes
	6.12 Stop PS-Processes
	6.13 Done! ~1.4 hours

Postprocessing stage!

7. Collect Logs and vizualize model in TensorBoard
	7.1 Check FireWall rules (!) : open 6006 TCP-Port
	7.2 Run tensorboard on main-node

8. Evaluate trainde model on validation set
	8.1 Prepare and commit Evaluation code
	8.2 git pull
	8.3 Run
	8.4 wait...
	8.5 Average accuracy is ~96.5% (after 4 epochs)

9. Calculate AUC-Score and plot ROC-Curve
	9.1 Check Firewall rules : 8888 TCP-Port
	9.2 Configure jupyter: jupyter notebook --generate-config
	9.3 Allow connect to jupyter-server from all interfaces
	9.4 Run postprocessing code in jupyter notebook *
	9.5 AUC-Score is ~0.993

That is all!
